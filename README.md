# fbla-intro-to-programming_gpa_calc
 GPA Harbor is a grade point average calculator for North Creek High School students to use to accurately
 calculate their weighted and unweighted GPAs without struggle. The program is open-source, licensed software that
 was made by Mohamed Morsy, Viraat Nellutla, and Akshar Parmar for the FBLA Intro to Programming 2023-2024 event. This program
 is virus-free, uses the managed language C#, and has a simplistic user interface that doesn't distract the user. It was programmed
 in Visual Studio using the Windows Form Designer and uploaded to Github.
